<h2>
    Introduction
</h2>
<p >
    Hello, my name is Tanny and I am currently dual majoring in Mechanical Engineering and Applied Physics <br>
    at Lewis University. This is my second year here at Lewis and so far I think I'm doing pretty well. I am <br>
    a first generation Asian American but I was born here in the states. There really isn't that much interesting <br>
    about me, for the most part I just study, hang out with friends, and play video games. Outside of those things <br>
    I can't really think of anything else to say.
<p>
<h2>
    What I hope to Learn in This Course
</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type:square">
    <li>Better knowledge on computer science</li>
    <li>Further my programming skills</li>
    <li>Have a good time</li>
</ul>
<h2>
    My Favorite Hobby/Activity
</h2>
<p>
    My favorite hobby would probably be video games, although I haven't found myself a lot of time to play <br>
    as of recently. Video Games to me hold a pretty dear place in my heart as it's a way I have been able <br>
    to stay connected with friends that I no longer see in person. It's also made me new friends who I have <br>
    never met in person, people who sometimes live halfwaya across the world, but who I can still interact with <br>
    and have a commonality with.
